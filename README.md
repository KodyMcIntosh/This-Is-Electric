# This Is Electric - Website Project
### Project Overview
**Design and build a website for an Auckland-based electrician showcasing their services.**

This Is Electric's existing website wasnâ€™t performing well for them, and needed a full overhaul to meet their needs within their industry. I worked with them to design, build, and create all of the content on their new site. This meant getting to know their points of difference, and their services well enough to create useful and meaningful copy to accompany the design.
